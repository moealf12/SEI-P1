## Planning and Development Process

I've started with the game logic with javascript
I've tried a couple of ways to approach the game logic most of them was a big mess of 'if-statements' the code got messy and messy so I've decided  to go with a more cleaner Code by implementing the Minimax Algorithm  linking Every part of the algorithm tree With a function of Functions Each Function in the Main Function will Call itself to pass the values to the Other function in between the tree  "  the algorithm tree "
this kind of function's called "Recursive Function's" I've had a hard time doing this but in the end, it paid out  - I was able to get a clean code with a Super Smart ai with less if-else statesmenâ€™s and way more efficient code ..  

### Problem-Solving Strategy

Function's
Algorithm's


### Unsolved problems

List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
ai difficulty
a bigger board
2 humans vs 2 AI's
AI vs AI For then fun of it
